# RocketTracker

This gem is used with our task tracker http://rtrack.ru to monitor site status and traffic.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rocket_tracker'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rocket_tracker

## Usage

Create ```config/initializers/rocket_tracker.rb' with data given to you by rtrack:

    RocketTracker.configure do |c|
      c.api_key = "123"
      c.js_key = "456"
    end
    
Include api key for JS in ```layout/application.html``` if you want to monitor client-side page load speed:
